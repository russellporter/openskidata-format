/**
 * A ski area feature is derived from several sources:
 * - OpenStreetMap site=piste relations (must contain at least one lift or run of any kind)
 * - OpenStreetMap landuse=winter_sports areas (must contain at least one downhill/nordic (non-backcountry) run or operational lift)
 * - Skimap.org ski areas
 *
 * The processor attempts to merge the data of all sources to create a single ski area feature.
 *
 * In some cases merging may fail and duplicate ski areas will be produced. This is likely due to ambiguous data.
 * Check:
 * - that a site=piste relation contains all the lifts/runs. If many lifts/runs are missing, merging will fail.
 * - that if there are multiple landuse=winter_sports areas representing a single ski area. In this case a multipolygon relation should be used.
 * - that if there are multiple Skimap.org ski areas representing a single ski area.
 *
 * General recommendation for ski area tagging in OpenStreetMap:
 * - start with a landuse=winter_sports area as it's easy to set up and maintain.
 * - if that's not explicit enough, add a site=piste relation as well.
 *
 * Note: if runs are present but there is no associated ski area source, a ski area feature is generated with no name and no source.
